I am currently working on Baseball Rising as a gameplay engineer! In this game, you and your fellow group of cavemen and women must work together to create the world's first game of baseball while overcoming all the obstacles that come with living in the neolithic era!

The first task I worked on for Baseball Rising is developing an AI behavior tree for the boar enemy.

The boar is tasked to: 

1) Randomly wander across the playing area
  
2) When it encounters a base run towards the base

3) Once it reaches the base or when the base is moved, begin to wander again

My current task is working on refactoring the code base and remove older depricated files since we are currently transitioning to a different methodology to build our code.
