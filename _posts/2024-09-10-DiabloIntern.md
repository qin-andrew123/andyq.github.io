Over the summer of 2024, I had an amazing opportunity to work at Blizzard and work on Diablo 4 as a Gameplay Engineering Intern! I had the opportunity to work with the other 28 extremely talented gameplay programmers to improve Diablo 4. Through working with this team, I learned the importance of code reviewing and future proofing code as a lot of the time, when I thought that I had come up with a good enough solution, the team and my mentor were able to quickly provide comments on how I could make the code more relevant for future usage.

Some things that I was able to do as an intern was to help develop a new inventory tab for the upcoming Fall 2024 expansion! Additionally, I was able to optimize the minimap by removing duplicate icons and hard coded constants. Additionally, another cool UI task that I got to work on was creating new dynamic visual floating text and other visual feedback elements for players. Finally, on the non player facing side, I learned that design and the gameplay team go hand in hand and a lot of the time, gameplay is asked to create new features for designers. As a result, I was able to collaborate with various design teams to create test cheats and new designer variables to help improve the quality of life for the design teams.
