    Game Submission for the 2023 1-Bit Jam with the theme "Riches to Rags"

    Gameplay: You traverse the woods with a flashlight that is used to kill monsters instantly, however, each time you use your flashlight your light dims. Eventually you will be left with nothing. We wanted the player to feel powerful at the beginning of the game but despair as they are forced to use their power to survive in a situation with no hope.
