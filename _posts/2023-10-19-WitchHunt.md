This is Witch Hunt! A 20 minute playable experience that I created for one of my school projects. This game was designed by rolling dice to get certain constraints. Our constraints that we got were cooperative play, drafting, alignment, and a mystery or detective narrative. 

I collaborated with 3 other students and we shared the burden of designing together between all four of us but I primarily took on the role of a producer and made sure that our tasks and deliverables were on schedule through scheduling regular team meetings. 

We also worked on creating playtest surveys to help gather data from each playtest that we performed. The main focus of a lot of our questions were to see if playtesters felt that they were working together as a team as well as if our puzzle aspect of the game made sense or not for the players. This is because our project had a two week deadline and because this was our first time creating a puzzle game, we were struggling to tweak our puzzle and improve it to make the puzzle not only unique each time players played the game, but also difficult enough to give players the sense of being a detective.

If we were given more time, one definite point of improvement we would do is to improve our puzzle and to make players feel more cohesive and that they were working together.
