I am currently working on Baseball Rising as a gameplay engineer! In this game, you and your fellow group of cavemen and women must work together to create the world's first game of baseball while overcoming all the obstacles that come with living in the neolithic era!

I am primarily working on developing an AI behavior tree for the boar enemy for Baseball Rising.

The boar is tasked to: 

1) Randomly wander across the playing area
  
2) When it encounters a base run towards the base

3) Once it reaches the base or when the base is moved, begin to wander again

4) If it encounters a bee, run away from the bee

Aside from this, I also assisted in adding documentation to some of the files and also worked on cleaning up deprecated files from our code base.
