This was one of the first projects that I worked on when I decided to transition from my Biology major in undergrad to pursuing Game Development. I had contacted Professor Sanjay Madhav who worked at USC and I asked if I could follow along using his textbook and his class that he taught at USC and he gave me permission to use his resources. There were several other games that I had the opportunity to recreate. For example:
- A starfox inspired infinite runner
- A basic level of Legend of Zelda which taught me the basics of A* pathfinding and AI state machines
- Mario Kart level that taught me different types of 3rd person cameras and how to manipulate physics to create more stylized movement for characters
- And many more!


## The Portal Remake

This Portal remake was the final project in his curriculum. Unfortunately, the some of the assets that I was given were incorrect and did not load in correctly, however, I continued the project because I was grateful for the opportunity to learn the technique than working about the broken assets.

This project taught me a lot of different topics such as expanding on AI state machines, utilizing linear algebra to implement teleportation and portal views as shown in the clip below

Furthermore, I learned how to implement UI such as damage indicators and game over, as well as flavor text such as the subtitles from GLaDOS.

Overall, I believe that this was my first big step into learning game develompent!
