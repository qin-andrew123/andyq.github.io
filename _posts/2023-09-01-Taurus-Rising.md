This is Taurus Rising! A game centered on making choices of sacrifing other alien races for the sake of saving your own or choosing to help the other alien races.

- I worked on implementing a "Harvesting" mechanic in the game which absorbs the asteroids in the game that the player is supposed to harvest. Harvest enough, and you will be able to advance to the next level
