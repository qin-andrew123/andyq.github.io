Potion Problems is the capstone project that I have decided to work on for the Fall 2024 - Spring 2025 school year. It is a multiplayer 2D social deducation game where you must figure out who the troublemakers in the group are while creating your own version of fun through mayhem inducing potions!

We started work during the summer of 2024 where I was assigned to designing how to implement game sessions. We decided that we should host through Steam so that we could target as many players as possible as well as deploying to both Mac and Windows. Our end product in the Summer was a prototype that could join player hosted sessions as well as type to each other through text chat.

As a Co-Lead on this project, I was responsible for guiding newer programmers through Unreal as well as helping production set up and distribute tasks among the programmers. I also helped with establishing coding practices such as code review as well as coding standards.

In Fall 2024, the trajectory of our project looked very good. We were on track to start developing potions, the main point of the game, and we had more than 20 total potions which we had to decide how to program.
