The Guardian is the capstone game project of one of the MS Game Development students which is about a large guardian being and a boy who must traverse the world and along the way develop a strong bond of family.

As a volunteer, I was given various tasks across the game ranging from UI assignments to tweaking UI and bug fixes.
