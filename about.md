Hello! I'm Andy Qin, a student at USC Games! I'm currently studying my Masters in Computer Science Game Development. I mostly work in Unity and Unreal, but I'm currently trying to learn how to develop my own engine! I have been fortunate enough to be able to contribute to many really cool projects while studying at USC. Feel free to check them out!
